## Quick Start

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aree6/LiftShift/main/public/Step1.png" alt="Export data from Hevy app" width="200" />
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aree6/LiftShift/main/public/Step2.png" alt="Upload CSV to LiftShift" width="200" />
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aree6/LiftShift/main/public/Step3.png" alt="Explore analytics dashboard" width="200" />
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aree6/LiftShift/main/public/Step4.png" alt="Get real-time feedback and filter data" width="200" />
</div>


1. **Select your platform** (Hevy / Strong)  
2. **Hevy**: Choose your **body type** + **weight unit**, then **Continue** to login/sync (or import CSV). / **Strong**: Choose body type + unit, then import CSV  
3. **Explore** your analytics across Dashboard, Exercises, and History tabs  
4. **Get insights** with real-time feedback and flexible filtering  

 Strong CSV imports support common export variants, including:
 - Semicolon-delimited (`;`) files with quoted fields
 - Unit-suffixed headers like `Weight (kg)` and `Distance (meters)`

## Troubleshooting

If you see this error:

> "We detected a Hevy workout CSV, but couldn't parse the workout dates. This usually happens when the Hevy export language isn't English. Please switch Hevy app language to English, export again, and re-upload."

Do the following:

1. Switch your Hevy app language to **English**
2. Export your workout CSV again
3. Re-upload it to LiftShift
