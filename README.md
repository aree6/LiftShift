## Troubleshooting

If you see this error:

> "We detected a Hevy workout CSV, but couldn't parse the workout dates. This usually happens when the Hevy export language isn't English. Please switch Hevy app language to English, export again, and re-upload."

Do the following:

1. Switch your Hevy app language to **English**
2. Export your workout CSV again
3. Re-upload it to LiftShift
