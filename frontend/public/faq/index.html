        <h2>What is LiftShift?</h2>
        <p>
          LiftShift is a free, privacy-focused workout analytics dashboard. It turns workout logs into charts and definitions
          you can interpret (training volume, PRs, exercise history, and muscle emphasis).
        </p>

        <h2>Does LiftShift store my workout history on its servers?</h2>
        <p>
          LiftShift is designed so most analytics are computed locally in your browser. It does not require you to upload
          your full training history to a LiftShift-owned database. See <a href="../privacy/">/privacy/</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Which apps are supported?</h2>
        <p>
          LiftShift supports importing workout data from:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="../supported-apps/hevy/">Hevy</a></li>
          <li><a href="../supported-apps/strong/">Strong</a></li>
          <li><a href="../supported-apps/lyfta/">Lyfta</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What does LiftShift consider a PR?</h2>
        <p>
          LiftShift uses explicit PR definitions. A PR is your best-ever performance for an exercise under the selected definition.
          See <a href="../metrics/personal-records/">/metrics/personal-records/</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Why might my charts look wrong?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Exercise names differ across sessions (e.g., “Bench Press” vs “Barbell Bench”).</li>
          <li>Units changed (kg vs lb) in the source export.</li>
          <li>Warmup sets are included or excluded differently than you expect.</li>
          <li>Missing sessions or incomplete logs reduce trend signal.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Is LiftShift a coaching app?</h2>
        <p>
          No. LiftShift is analytics for your logs. It does not generate training programs and it is not medical advice.
